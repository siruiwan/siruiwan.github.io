I am an educational and developmental psychologist studying why people pursue specific educational trajectories and career paths. My dissertation focuses on studentsâ€™ tendency to look for and exaggerate potential discrepancies between their relative strengths and weaknesses across academic subjects during K-12. The ultimate goal of my research is to imply how to help students, especially those from historically underrepresented and marginalized groups, fulfill their potential. 

I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine where I worked with  Drs. [Drew H. Bailey](https://sites.uci.edu/dhbailey/) and [Jacquelynne S. Eccles](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5971). In summer 2022, I will join the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a postdoctoral researcher, working with Dr. [Judith Harackiewicz](https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/harackiewicz-judy/). 

My work has been published in journals such as _Psychological Bulletin_, _Cognition_, and _Economics of Education Review_. I am a recipient of multiple honors, including [the APA Dissertation Research Award](https://www.apa.org/science/awards/2021-dissertation-research-award), [the Graduate Student Research Excellence Award from AERA Division C](https://www.aera.net/Division-C/Awards), and [the UCI Graduate Dean's Dissertation Fellowship](https://education.uci.edu/ucisoe_news/wan_gddf_june21).
