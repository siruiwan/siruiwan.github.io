I am an educational and developmental psychologist studying why people pursue/avoid specific educational trajectories and career paths. The ultimate goal of my research is to inform how to support youth, especially those from historically underrepresented and marginalized groups, in reaching their full potential. 

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Mississippi. I completed my postdoctoral training in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and earned my Ph.D. from the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine.  

My work has been published in journals such as _Psychological Bulletin_, _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, _Child Development_, and _Journal of Educational Psychology_. I am a recipient of multiple honors, including [the APA Dissertation Research Award](https://www.apa.org/science/awards/2021-dissertation-research-award), [the Graduate Student Research Excellence Award from AERA Division C](https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Awards/Division-Awards/2022-Division-Awards), and [the Hershel D. Thornburg Dissertation Award from the Society for Research on Adolescence](https://srad.memberclicks.net/2024-annual-meeting-in-chicago-portal). My research is funded by [the AVDF/ACLS Fellowships for Research on the Liberal Arts](https://www.acls.org/programs/avdf-acls-fellowships-for-research-on-the-liberal-arts/).

I am recruiting new Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2026 through [the Experimental Psychology Program](https://olemiss.edu/psychology/academics/graduate-experimental/) at the University of Mississippi.
